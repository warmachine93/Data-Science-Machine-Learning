These Files contains various projects I have developed with the help of concepts that I have learnt throughout my Data Science academics and via external sources like udemay and hackerrank.
All of these projects are emphasizing the Data Science approch to solve real world problems.
These projects use Machine Learning libraries such as pandas, keras, seaborn, matplotlib, pytorch.
All the projects are made on Google Collab.
